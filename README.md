# Space X
### Static mockup of Space X's running website.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, vanilla JS.

This is a practice project where I had the opportunity to build a mockup of Space X's website following Traversy Media. Along the way I learned how multi-page websites are created and implemented. I used some basic logic, functionality and animations for the counters and menu overlays.
