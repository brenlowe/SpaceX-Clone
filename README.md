### Space X
Static mockup of Space X's running website.

This is a practice project where I had the opportunity to recreate a finished website using static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- Learned and implemented how multi page sites work with vanilla html, css, and js. 
- Used some basic logic and functionality for the counters and menu overlay in JS.
